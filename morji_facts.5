.Sh NAME
.Nm morji_facts
.Nd morji facts syntax
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The morji database contains a set of facts encoding question/answer
information.
Each fact can have one or more cards.
.Pp
There are three types of facts:
.Cm oneside ,
.Cm twoside
and
.Cm cloze .
Facts of type
.Cm oneside
generate simple question/answer cards.
Facts of type
.Cm twoside
are pairs of the form front/back and back/front, particularly useful for
vocabulary for generating recognition and production cards.
Facts of type
.Cm cloze
generate question/answer cards, where the question has some text
replaced by […] or a hint, and the answer contains the replaced text.
.Pp
Facts are written using the following syntax:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
@Question: question text with some [em emphasis]
@Answer: answer text
@Notes: some notes
@Type: oneside (or twoside or cloze)
@Tags: some-tag
.Ed
.Pp
The @Question: field contains the question text.
The text can contain markup commands in brackets with the syntax:
.Cm \&[ Ns Ar cmd args ... Cm \&] .
The list of arguments is a Tcl list.
This means that braces and quotes can be used to write arguments containing
spaces.
Markup commands can easily be defined in morji's initialization file, see
.Xr morji_config 5 .
The following markup commands are predefined:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm em Ar args ...
This command emphasizes arguments joined with space interleaved.
.It Cm lbracket , rbracket
These commands can be used to write literal left and right square brackets.
.It Cm cloze Ar cloze-text Ar ?hint?
This command is used for facts of type
.Cm cloze .
The argument
.Ar cloze-text
is the text that should appear in the answer.
The optional argument
.Ar hint
is the text that replaces the cloze text.
If no hint is provided, three dots […] are used.
It should be noted that in cloze-deletion facts, several
.Cm cloze
commands can be used, resulting in generation of several cards, one for each
.Cm cloze
command.
.El
.Pp
The @Answer: field contains the answer text.
Its syntax is the same as with the @Question: field.
This field is not used for facts of type
.Cm cloze
(answer is generated from cloze text).
.Pp
The @Notes: field contains some additional notes.
The syntax is the same as with @Question: and @Answer:.
It is particularly useful for facts of type
.Cm twoside ,
because it allows to show in the answer the same additional information for the
two sister-cards.
.Pp
The @Type: field contains the name of the type of the fact.
.Pp
The @Tags: field contains a Tcl list of tags associated with the fact, which
can be used to organize facts by themes.
.Ss Importing facts
morji allows to import facts from a file.
Each line is a fact and has five tab-separated fields, in order: question,
answer, notes, type, tags.
The syntax of each field is the same as with the interactive method of
introducing new cards.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Example of fact of type
.Cm oneside :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
@Question: What is the word for “remember”?
@Answer: morji
@Notes:
@Type: oneside
@Tags: lojban
.Ed
.Pp
This fact will generate one card with question and answer fields as expected.
.Pp
Example of fact of type
.Cm twoside :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
@Question: rememori
@Answer: se rappeler (quelque chose)
@Notes:
@Type: twoside
@Tags: esperanto-french
.Ed
.Pp
This fact will generate two cards: one from esperanto to french, and another
from french to esperanto.
.Pp
Example of fact of type
.Cm cloze :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
@Question: Zer da lore hau? Ez dut [cloze gogoratu remember].
@Notes:
@Type: cloze
@Tags: euskara
.Ed
.Pp
This fact will generate one card.
The question will get the hint part of the cloze command: “remember” (in bold between
square brackets).
The answer will get the cloze part of the cloze command: “gogoratu”.
